title: Taxim app
---

- Sometimes there are no taxis in a series of routes because the drivers think that there are no passengers in those routes, as a result of this, I made a website (Taxim app).

- I used different html for different pages of the website, inside each html I used different sections and divs to write content, I also used some css files for some colors and designs. I also used Django to save the data.

- this is the link of my website
