[fractal of triangel ](../assets/triangel_11zon.jpg)


- to draw the fractal of star again use recursive function . and the color is the same as fractal of triangel :
[code fractal of star ](../assets/codestar_11zon.jpg)
[picture fractal of star ](../assets/picturestar_11zon.jpg)


- to draw the fractal of star again use recursive function . and the color is the same as fractal of triangel :
